- instead of adding a sql new migration, always just edit the existing sql file
  in `/supabase/schemas/`.  i have a separate script for applying modified
  migrations to production. After making the modification to `schemas`, pause
  and ask for confirmation before continuing with the implementation.
- when relevant, postgresql tables should have create_at columns and updated_at
  columns that are generated using public.set_updated_at from 0000_utils.sql
